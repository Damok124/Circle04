Now, create two classes: HumanA and HumanB. They both have a Weapon and a
name. They also have a member function attack() that displays (of course, without the
angle brackets):
<name> attacks with their <weapon type>
HumanA and HumanB are almost the same except for these two tiny details:
• While HumanA takes the Weapon in its constructor, HumanB doesn’t.
• HumanB may not always have a Weapon, whereas HumanA will always be armed.
